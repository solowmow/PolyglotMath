# PolyglotMath

## Overview
PolyglotMath is a comprehensive showcase of mathematical computations implemented in seven programming languages. This repository demonstrates various mathematical tasks across Python, MATLAB, R, Julia, C/C++, Java, and JavaScript, offering a comparative analysis of their strengths and efficiencies.

## Contents
The repository contains folders/files structured as follows:

### Python
- **matrix_operations.py**: Handles matrix calculations.
- **fibonacci.py**: Computes the Fibonacci sequence.
- **monte_carlo.py**: Implements Monte Carlo simulations.
- **sorting_algorithms.py**: Includes various sorting and searching algorithms.

### MATLAB
- **matrix_operations.m**: MATLAB script for matrix operations.
- **fibonacci.m**: MATLAB script for Fibonacci computation.
- **monte_carlo.m**: Monte Carlo simulations in MATLAB.
- **sorting_algorithms.m**: MATLAB implementation of sorting and searching algorithms.

(Repeat similar structures for other languages...)

## Usage
Each language-specific folder contains scripts/files for respective mathematical tasks. To use, navigate to the language folder and execute the specific script using the corresponding interpreter/compiler.
